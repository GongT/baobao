	/**
	 * Configures the mechanism via which the service notifies the manager that the service start-up has finished. One of simple, exec, forking, oneshot, dbus, notify,
	 *
	 * notify-reload, or idle:
	 *
	 * •   If set to simple (the default if ExecStart= is specified but neither Type= nor BusName= are), the service manager will consider the unit started immediately
	 *
	 * after the main service process has been forked off (i.e. immediately after fork(), and before various process attributes have been configured and in particular
	 *
	 * before the new process has called execve() to invoke the actual service binary). Typically, Type=exec is the better choice, see below.
	 *
	 * It is expected that the process configured with ExecStart= is the main process of the service. In this mode, if the process offers functionality to other
	 *
	 * processes on the system, its communication channels should be installed before the service is started up (e.g. sockets set up by systemd, via socket
	 *
	 * activation), as the service manager will immediately proceed starting follow-up units, right after creating the main service process, and before executing the
	 *
	 * service's binary. Note that this means systemctl start command lines for simple services will report success even if the service's binary cannot be invoked
	 *
	 * successfully (for example because the selected User= doesn't exist, or the service binary is missing).
	 *
	 * •   The exec type is similar to simple, but the service manager will consider the unit started immediately after the main service binary has been executed. The
	 *
	 * service manager will delay starting of follow-up units until that point. (Or in other words: simple proceeds with further jobs right after fork() returns, while
	 *
	 * exec will not proceed before both fork() and execve() in the service process succeeded.) Note that this means systemctl start command lines for exec services
	 *
	 * will report failure when the service's binary cannot be invoked successfully (for example because the selected User= doesn't exist, or the service binary is
	 *
	 * missing).
	 *
	 * •   If set to forking, the manager will consider the unit started immediately after the binary that forked off by the manager exits.  The use of this type is
	 *
	 * discouraged, use notify, notify-reload, or dbus instead.
	 *
	 * It is expected that the process configured with ExecStart= will call fork() as part of its start-up. The parent process is expected to exit when start-up is
	 *
	 * complete and all communication channels are set up. The child continues to run as the main service process, and the service manager will consider the unit
	 *
	 * started when the parent process exits. This is the behavior of traditional UNIX services. If this setting is used, it is recommended to also use the PIDFile=
	 *
	 * option, so that systemd can reliably identify the main process of the service. The manager will proceed with starting follow-up units after the parent process
	 *
	 * exits.
	 *
	 * •   Behavior of oneshot is similar to simple; however, the service manager will consider the unit up after the main process exits. It will then start follow-up
	 *
	 * units.  RemainAfterExit= is particularly useful for this type of service.  Type=oneshot is the implied default if neither Type= nor ExecStart= are specified.
	 *
	 * Note that if this option is used without RemainAfterExit= the service will never enter "active" unit state, but will directly transition from "activating" to
	 *
	 * "deactivating" or "dead", since no process is configured that shall run continuously. In particular this means that after a service of this type ran (and which
	 *
	 * has RemainAfterExit= not set) it will not show up as started afterwards, but as dead.
	 *
	 * •   Behavior of dbus is similar to simple; however, units of this type must have the BusName= specified and the service manager will consider the unit up when the
	 *
	 * specified bus name has been acquired. This type is the default if BusName= is specified.
	 *
	 * Service units with this option configured implicitly gain dependencies on the dbus.socket unit. A service unit of this type is considered to be in the
	 *
	 * activating state until the specified bus name is acquired. It is considered activated while the bus name is taken. Once the bus name is released the service is
	 *
	 * considered being no longer functional which has the effect that the service manager attempts to terminate any remaining processes belonging to the service.
	 *
	 * Services that drop their bus name as part of their shutdown logic thus should be prepared to receive a SIGTERM (or whichever signal is configured in
	 *
	 * KillSignal=) as result.
	 *
	 * •   Behavior of notify is similar to exec; however, it is expected that the service sends a "READY=1" notification message via sd_notify(3) or an equivalent call
	 *
	 * when it has finished starting up. systemd will proceed with starting follow-up units after this notification message has been sent. If this option is used,
	 *
	 * NotifyAccess= (see below) should be set to open access to the notification socket provided by systemd. If NotifyAccess= is missing or set to none, it will be
	 *
	 * forcibly set to main.
	 *
	 * If the service supports reloading, and uses a signal to start the reload, using notify-reload instead is recommended.
	 *
	 * •   Behavior of notify-reload is similar to notify, with one difference: the SIGHUP UNIX process signal is sent to the service's main process when the service is
	 *
	 * asked to reload and the manager will wait for a notification about the reload being finished.
	 *
	 * When initiating the reload process the service is expected to reply with a notification message via sd_notify(3) that contains the "RELOADING=1" field in
	 *
	 * combination with "MONOTONIC_USEC=" set to the current monotonic time (i.e.  CLOCK_MONOTONIC in clock_gettime(2)) in μs, formatted as decimal string. Once
	 *
	 * reloading is complete another notification message must be sent, containing "READY=1". Using this service type and implementing this reload protocol is an
	 *
	 * efficient alternative to providing an ExecReload= command for reloading of the service's configuration.
	 *
	 * The signal to send can be tweaked via ReloadSignal=, see below.
	 *
	 * •   Behavior of idle is very similar to simple; however, actual execution of the service program is delayed until all active jobs are dispatched. This may be used
	 *
	 * to avoid interleaving of output of shell services with the status output on the console. Note that this type is useful only to improve console output, it is not
	 *
	 * useful as a general unit ordering tool, and the effect of this service type is subject to a 5s timeout, after which the service program is invoked anyway.
	 *
	 * It is recommended to use Type=exec for long-running services, as it ensures that process setup errors (e.g. errors such as a missing service executable, or missing
	 *
	 * user) are properly tracked. However, as this service type won't propagate the failures in the service's own startup code (as opposed to failures in the preparatory
	 *
	 * steps the service manager executes before execve()) and doesn't allow ordering of other units against completion of initialization of the service code itself (which
	 *
	 * for example is useful if clients need to connect to the service through some form of IPC, and the IPC channel is only established by the service itself — in
	 *
	 * contrast to doing this ahead of time through socket or bus activation or similar), it might not be sufficient for many cases. If so, notify, notify-reload, or dbus
	 *
	 * (the latter only in case the service provides a D-Bus interface) are the preferred options as they allow service program code to precisely schedule when to consider
	 *
	 * the service started up successfully and when to proceed with follow-up units. The notify/notify-reload service types require explicit support in the service
	 *
	 * codebase (as sd_notify() or an equivalent API needs to be invoked by the service at the appropriate time) — if it's not supported, then forking is an alternative:
	 *
	 * it supports the traditional heavy-weight UNIX service start-up protocol. Note that using any type other than simple possibly delays the boot process, as the service
	 *
	 * manager needs to wait for at least some service initialization to complete. (Also note it is generally not recommended to use idle or oneshot for long-running
	 *
	 * services.)
	 *
	 * Note that various service settings (e.g.  User=, Group= through libc NSS) might result in "hidden" blocking IPC calls to other services when used. Sometimes it
	 *
	 * might be advisable to use the simple service type to ensure that the service manager's transaction logic is not affected by such potentially slow operations and
	 *
	 * hidden dependencies, as this is the only service type where the service manager will not wait for such service execution setup operations to complete before
	 *
	 * proceeding.

	/**
	 * Configure the out-of-memory (OOM) killing policy for the kernel and the userspace OOM killer systemd-oomd.service(8). On Linux, when memory becomes scarce to the
	 *
	 * point that the kernel has trouble allocating memory for itself, it might decide to kill a running process in order to free up memory and reduce memory pressure.
	 *
	 * Note that systemd-oomd.service is a more flexible solution that aims to prevent out-of-memory situations for the userspace too, not just the kernel, by attempting
	 *
	 * to terminate services earlier, before the kernel would have to act.
	 *
	 * This setting takes one of continue, stop or kill. If set to continue and a process in the unit is killed by the OOM killer, this is logged but the unit continues
	 *
	 * running. If set to stop the event is logged but the unit is terminated cleanly by the service manager. If set to kill and one of the unit's processes is killed by
	 *
	 * the OOM killer the kernel is instructed to kill all remaining processes of the unit too, by setting the memory.oom.group attribute to 1; also see kernel page
	 *
	 * Control Group v2[3].
	 *
	 * Defaults to the setting DefaultOOMPolicy= in systemd-system.conf(5) is set to, except for units where Delegate= is turned on, where it defaults to continue.
	 *
	 * Use the OOMScoreAdjust= setting to configure whether processes of the unit shall be considered preferred or less preferred candidates for process termination by the
	 *
	 * Linux OOM killer logic. See systemd.exec(5) for details.
	 *
	 * This setting also applies to systemd-oomd.service(8). Similarly to the kernel OOM kills performed by the kernel, this setting determines the state of the unit after
	 *
	 * systemd-oomd kills a cgroup associated with it.
	 *
	 * Added in version 243.

	 * Takes an argument of the form "path[:fd-name:options]", where:
	 *
	 * •   "path" is a path to a file or an AF_UNIX socket in the file system;
	 *
	 * •   "fd-name" is a name that will be associated with the file descriptor; the name may contain any ASCII character, but must exclude control characters and ":", and
	 *
	 * must be at most 255 characters in length; it is optional and, if not provided, defaults to the file name;
	 *
	 * •   "options" is a comma-separated list of access options; possible values are "read-only", "append", "truncate", "graceful"; if not specified, files will be opened
	 *
	 * in rw mode; if "graceful" is specified, errors during file/socket opening are ignored. Specifying the same option several times is treated as an error.
	 *
	 * The file or socket is opened by the service manager and the file descriptor is passed to the service. If the path is a socket, we call connect() on it. See
	 *
	 * sd_listen_fds(3) for more details on how to retrieve these file descriptors.
	 *
	 * This setting is useful to allow services to access files/sockets that they can't access themselves (due to running in a separate mount namespace, not having
	 *
	 * privileges, ...).
	 *
